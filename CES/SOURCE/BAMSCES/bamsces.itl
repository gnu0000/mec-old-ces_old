  :h1 res=1000.FILE MENU
:p.The :hp4.File Menu:ehp4. lets you perform the following file-related 
functions:  opening new and existing programs and jobs, opening catalogs, 
closing windows, setting up the printer and printing, importing and 
exporting files, running browsers and other system applications, and 
exiting the program.   
:p.The File window is always available (except when a dialog box is open) and will 
always have the same menu choices, although not all the sub menus will be available 
all the time.  For example, the Print menu prints reports based on the active window; 
therefore, only the print choices that logically apply to that window will be 
available.  Nevertheless, these commands are always executable. 
These menu choices will be discussed in the order they appear under the File 
menu choice.
:p.Several of these choices call up dialog boxes (boxes that allow you to interact 
with the program to tailor the results to your preferences), and these will be 
discussed in turn.

  :h1 res=1096.New Job
:p.The :hp4.New Job:ehp4. command allows you to create an entirely new job at any time during 
your work in CES.  Executing this command causes the full screen dialog box 
to appear.  
:p.Boxes with down-pointing arrows to their right are combination boxes
that is, they have a self-contained list from which you must choose your entry.  
In most cases, these boxes will not accept typed entry, only selected entry. 
View the lists in these boxes by clicking on the arrow or by scrolling through 
the list with the keyboard arrow keys.
:p.To create a new job, perform the following steps:  
:ul compact.
:li.Select the New Job command from the File menu.
:li.Fill in the plain entry fields by manually typing in the data.  The Location 
field must be expressed in terms of latitude and longitude (degrees, minutes, 
and seconds) and the Construction and Contingency percents must be entered as 
percent values--for 8 percent, type either .08 or 8%. 
:li.For the seven combination boxes (Checked by, Approved by, Estimator, Work 
Type, Work Day Calendar, Letting Month, and District), choose from the lists 
provided.  These fields will not accept typed-in data.   
:li.The small square next to the Location box specifies whether or not Davis-Bacon 
wages apply.  Click on this box to toggle its display.  An X in the box means the 
condition is positive (checked) and therefore Davis-Bacon wages would apply.  
:li.At this point you can accept the job, go back and make any changes necessary 
by choosing the box that needs correction, or cancel the entire entry.  You can 
use the Help command at any stage in the process to get help with the current 
menu or dialog box.
:eul.
  
  :h1 res=1095.New Program
:p.The :hp4.New Program:ehp4. command displays the New Program.  This allows 
you to define an entirely new road construction program.

:ul compact.
:li.Perform the File, New Program command sequence.
:li.Fill in the four entry fields.  CES can read most date formats.
:li.Accept the entry, cancel the entry, ask for help, or accept the entry 
and create another new program with the Add More command.
:eul.
  
  :h1 res=1098.Open Job
:p.The :hp4.Open Job:ehp4. command opens a window listing all the Jobs 
currently in the database. If no jobs exist, a skeleton screen will appear.
:p.From here, the user can cancel, ask for help, or select a job and hit OK. 
All of the list boxes provided by CES will automatically highlight (select) 
the first item in the list.  Therefore, if you select OK without choosing 
some other item, the first item will be chosen.
   
  :h1 res=1097.Open Program
:p.The :hp4.Open Program:ehp4. command displays a list of the existing road 
construction programs.  If no programs have been defined, CES will display 
a skeleton Open Program box.
Once at this window, you can request help, select a program and hit enter 
or OK, or cancel the Open Program operation.
:p.The parent/child window hierarchy in BAMS/CES is not strict.  
Therefore, if you began your work session by opening the Program window, 
you can move to one of the job-related windows by viewing the jobs in 
this program, selecting one of them, and then proceeding as if you had 
begun with the Open Job sequence.

:p.The Working Day Calendar Catalog window displays a list of working day 
calendars and describes situations for which these calendars apply.
(A working day calendar shows the number of working days in a month, as opposed 
to the total number of days in a month.)  

     :p. :link reftype=hd res=13820.Zone Type Catalog:elink.
:p.The Zone Type Catalog window can displays a list of all zone types used by 
BAMS/CES. A zone is an area of the state that does not depend on county 
boundaries.  

  :h1 res=1014.Close
:p.The :hp4.Close:ehp4. command closes the currently active window.  It performs the same 
function as the dash (control bar) in the upper left-hand 
corner of each active window.  Thus, if you have several windows open, this 
command will close only the active window.  If the active window is a Program 
or Job window, this command will close the Program or Job.  
:p.Due to the tree-structure nature of this program, there will be times when many 
windows will be open at one time.  You may wish to close all of them before exiting 
or you may simply close them to keep system performance as high as possible.  In 
either case, there are two ways to close all the open windows:  The obvious way 
is to close each window in the opposite order in which they were opened.  
However, this can be frustrating and time consuming if more than three or four 
are open.
:p.The simpler way to do this is to click on the first window opened.  CES will 
display it in front of the other windows (its children).  
Close the first one (the parent) and all its children will 
close automatically with it.  This demands some foresight in that some portion 
of the window must be visible in order to be able to click on it.  In addition, 
it is helpful if you can see the window title.  
:p.Therefore, a good method for using multiple windows in CES is to move each new 
window just beneath its parent.  This is done by clicking in the title bar 
the top half inch of every screen) and dragging it to its new location.  Then 
the title bar of each window will be visible.  This yeilds other benefits as 
well since it allows you to selectively go back to earlier windows.

.* Print Menu Help **
.********************

  :h1 res=1015.Print Menu
:p.The :hp4.Print:ehp4. command generates reports based on the active window.
In other words, it will print the report that summarizes the active window.
In  many cases, there will be only one choice from the print menu,
since there will be only one report based on that window.
:p.Below is the list of reports printed by CES.  As stated above, availability 
depends on the active window.  If a report title is gray, it is unavailable 
at this time.
:p.If a print option in the dialog boxes is grayed, it is currently under 
development and was not functional for this Beta release.
Note however that all the print options will be gray when the print menu is 
first activated (like the windows in CES). This allows the program time to 
process the various information it needs to perform the commands.  The length 
of time these will remain gray depends on the amount of information in the 
database and the amount of activity on the network if one is installed.

search from that item forward.  
:li.Select the work types, road types, and districts you want included in the search.  
You can select several from each of these boxes.  As in the range selectors above, 
the default search is the entire list.  Therefore, if the work type, road type, 
and  districts boxes have no selected items, the search will not be constrained.  
Selecting some of the items limits the search to the selected items.  (See Chapter 
3, Section 5, the Tutorial chapter for a detailed description of selecting multiple

.* Edit Commands Help **

  :h1 res=1101.Add
:p.The :hp4.Add:ehp4. command  adds another element to the currently active 
window (an element could be a job, a job item, etc.)  This window is 
context-sensitive, in other words, the information added will depend upon the 
window  that is active. In most cases this will call up a blank dialog box 
for that window.  You then fill in the boxes by typing data in the plain boxes,
selecting from the lists provided in the combination boxes (arrows on the right 
of the box), and clicking on the selection boxes (little square boxes that 
toggle between checked and not checked).

  :h1 res=1102.Change
:p.The :hp4.Change:ehp4. command changes an element  in the currently active 
window.  This command is also context-sensitive.  This command will call up a 
dialog box identical to that of the Edit, Add command sequence, except that 
the Change dialog box will be filled out.  You access this box by selecting 
the item you wish to change and then performing the Edit, Change command 
sequence. After you have finished your changes, you can either accept them, 
get help, or cancel.  If you select cancel, none of the changes you have made 
in this dialog box will be saved.  There is not an Add More choice button; 
therefore, you must invoke the Change dialog box each time you wish to make 
a change to some element.   

:h1 res=1103.Delete
:p.The :hp4.Delete:ehp4. command deletes an element from the currently active 
window.  It is also context-sensitive.  For example, to delete a county from 
the county catalog, you must open the county catalog and select the county or 
counties you wish to delete.  If nothing is selected, nothing will be deleted. 
The program will not provide a duplicate of the Add/Change dialog box but will
provide a choice box on the screen, asking you to confirm or cancel the deletion.  
The default for this question is no (the No choice will be highlighted when 
the box appears).  Therefore, if you hit enter without thinking, the item will 
not be deleted.   

  :h1 res=1104.Cut
:p.The :hp4.Cut:ehp4. command deletes the currently selected element from the 
text and moves it to the clipboard.  You can then paste (insert) it back into 
the same location or a different one.  One example for a use of this command 
is cutting a job item to a different job.  Move to the Job Items window, 
select a Job Item, and then perform the Edit, Cut command sequence. The item 
will disappear from the window but will be retained in RAM.  You then find 
the place you want to insert it and perform the Edit, Paste command sequence.
There is no time limit for elements in the clipboard, as long as CES is running 
and nothing else is put in.  You can perform several other functions, change 
windows, and add new or change current data, before you paste the information 
to the desired location. As with all commands in a Windows style format, if 
the command is grayed, it is not functional or available at that time.

  :h1 res=1105.Copy
:p.The :hp4.Copy:ehp4. command sequence stores any selected text into the 
clipboard.  The difference between the Cut and Copy commands is that with the 
Copy command, the clipboard contents remain in their original location as well
as being retained in the clipboard.  The Cut command deletes them from the 
text, although they can be replaced from the clipboard.

  :h1 res=1106.Paste
:p.The :hp4.Paste:ehp4. command copies the clipboard contents to the currently 
selected window.  If the text being copied is not the correct format, there 
will be an error message.  For example, if the window requires a numerical 
entry and the user enters text data, this will cause an error message.  However, 
if the user simply copies a personal or company name where the name of a 
bridge should have gone,the program has no way to distinguish the correct from 
the incorrect. As explained in the Cut and Copy sections, there is no time 
limit for pasting from the clipboard to the program.  As long as nothing else 
is put into the clipboard and CES is not shutdown, this data will be in the 
clipboard. Additionally, there is no limit on the number of times that an 
element can be pasted into CES.  The contents of the clipboard do not change 
after the paste operation.  This is a convenient feature if you need to insert 
one element into several places or if you insert it incorrectly the first time.  
If this happens, delete the new entry, move the cursor to the new location, and 
perform the Edit, Paste command sequence again.  If you did not add anything 
to the clipboard, the item you pasted incorrectly the first time will be pasted 
again.

  :h1 res=1301.Find
:p.The :hp4.Find:ehp4. command finds a specific element in a displayed list.  It is only available when a list box is active.  
:p.To use the Find command, perform the following steps:
:ul compact.
:li.Access the list box in which you wish to search.
:li.Perform the Utilities, Find menu choice sequence.
:li.CES will display the dialog box.
:li.Specify the parameters of the find, 
:li.Select OK, Cancel or Help to perform the desired function.
:li.Assume you wish to find a list of all the items with the word pipe in the short 
description.  Access the Standard Item Catalog and perform the Utilities, Find 
command sequence.  Choose short description as your data field, then type the 
phrase *PIPE* in the wildcard field.  This tells CES to find all items with the 
word pipe in the short description.  You can then specify whether CES finds 
matches earlier in the list than where you are now (previous matches) or 
later in the list (next match).  You can also choose to select all the items 
that match the search parameters.  These can then be printed for closer examination.
:eul.

  :h1 res=1302.Sort
:p.The :hp4.Sort:ehp4. command sorts a list of elements in the currently active list window.  
:p.This command is only available when accessing a list window.  You then have 
the option to sort on many fields of a list.  For instance, you could sort 
project cost data by unit cost, by volume, or by extended cost.

:p.To use the Sort command, perform the following steps:
:ul compact.
:li.Access the list box you wish to sort.
:li.Perform the Utilities, Sort menu choice sequence.
:li.CES will display the dialog box.
:li.Specify the parameters of the search. 
:li.Select OK, Cancel, or Help to perform the desired function.
In the Sort shown above, the Standard Item Catalog will be sorted by standard 
item first, and then by code value, both in ascending.  This means that CES will 
put the items in numerical order, starting with the lowest and going up.  Within 
that list they will be grouped by code value in alphabetical order.  So, for 
example, the standard items measured in cubic yards (CY) would be listed before 
those that are measured as lump sums (LS). 
:eul.

  :h1 res=1398.Update Base Date
:p.The :hp4.Update Base Date:ehp4. command attaches new reference data to all 
jobs.  Since projections of progress and interest rates are tied to this date, 
this can be an important change.
:p.To update the base date, perform the following steps:
Perform the Utilities, Update Base Date menu choice sequence.

  :h1 res=1397.Update Spec Year
:p.The :hp4.Update Spec year:ehp4. command gives the System Manager information 
on errors and/or messages.
To update the spec year, perform the following steps:
Perform the Utilities, Update Spec Year menu choice sequence.

  :h1 res=1303.Set Preferences
:p.The :hp4.Set Preferences:ehp4. command allows you to set preferences specific 
to your current environment.  Examples of user preferences are History Size, 
Auto Window Maximizing, Request Notification on Background Jobs When Complete, 
and Request Verification on Deletes.  History Size  If you have a very large 
database that spans many years you may want to limit its size for some estimation 
jobs.  This will improve system performance.
Auto Window Maximizing  This option makes every window you open go immediately 
to full screen size.  This can be helpful if you are working with catalogs 
such as the Standard Item Catalog, which is very large. 
Request Notification on Background Jobs  This option allows you to leave a job 
and proceed on to another one.  The program will put a message box over any 
screen where you are currently working.  
Request Verification on Deletes  The default setting for this option is on.  
Thus, whenever you delete an item, you will be asked if you are sure you want 
to do this. If you hit enter without thinking, the item will not be deleted 
since the warning box opens with the No option highlighted. 
If you do not wish this warning to be displayed, you can use the Request 
Verification option to turn off this feature.
To use the Set Preferences command, perform the following steps:
Perform the Utilities, Set Preferences menu choice sequence.

  :h1 res=1304.Change Password
:p.The :hp4.Change Password:ehp4. is command allows you to Change your CES 
account password.
To change your password, perform the following steps:
Perform the Utilities, Change Password menu choice sequence. 

  :h1 res=1305.Show Users
:p.The :hp4.Show Users:ehp4. command lists the users currently connected to 
any PC module.  Show Users also provides an option to log people off the 
network. This command is available only to System Managers.

  :h1 res=1306.Send Message
:p.The :hp4.Send Message:ehp4. command allows the user to send a message to

help, a help window is displayed the kind of help you get is determined by what 
you selected before you requested help.
 
   :h1 res=100.Keyboard
:p.The :hp4.Help Keyboard:ehp4. option explains the use of the keyboard with 
the CES application.  Most of the mouse-driven commands can be duplicated by the 
keyboard.
:p.To select one item, use the arrow key.  The program will select one item at 
a time, unselecting the one previous.  In other words, you can scroll through 
the list, until you reach the desired item.  If you stop on that item, it will 
be selected.  The space bar will toggle any item from selected to unselected or 
vice-versa.  The page, end, and home keys all work with this program.  The 
page down key will move the selection bar to the very bottom of the screen, 
selecting that bottom item or the one that starts the next screen.  This is 
dependant on the amount of the bottom line showing.  This key is sensitive
to the size of the window. For example, if the window is showing 11 items, it 
will go to the 12th item and select it.  If the screen is showing 24, it will 
select the 24th or 25th.  The page up key works in similar fashion, selecting 
the top item in the current window. The end key will select the last item in the 
list, while the home key will select the first (top) item in the list.  
The shift key used with the page down key will select from the start point to 
the bottom of the screen.  The shift key with the page up key will select from 
the start point to the top of the screen.  The shift and arrow key combination 
will drag the selection bar in the direction of the arrow.  This will select 
items as it goes.  The control and arrow key combination will move the selection 
bar to a new location.  The user can then select more text with the shift and 
arrow combination.  The arrow key will select one item and will unselect any 
items currently selected. 


  :h1 res=101.Mouse
:p.The :hp4.Help Mouse:ehp4. option explains the use of  the mouse with this 
application.  This topic explains the concepts of clicking, pointing, dragging,
etc.  It will also demonstrate the specific steps required to reach a certain 
menu level.
:p.To select only one item, simply click the left mouse button when the cursor 
arrow is at the desired item.  To select multiple items, click and hold the left 
button down while "dragging" the mouse.  This will select in either direction 
and,as long as you hold the mouse button down, you can unselect those you just 
selected if you overshoot the mark. The "Shift and Click" method combines the 
keyboard shift key with the mouse.  Hold the shift key down when you click on 
the item.  This will select all the items from the closest selected one to the 
cursor arrow.  This is similar to blocking text in a word processing program.  
The "Control and Click" method also uses the keyboard.  This sequence is used 
when the items you wish to block are not all together. For instance, in the 
Standard Item Catalog, the list is longer than will fit on one screen.  (An 
example of this type of a situation is printing a report or listing.  You may 
want to print only the standard items for this project rather than the whole 
Standard Item Catalog.)  Assume you wish to select the first eight, then skip 
four, then select seven more. Select the first block by clicking and dragging, 
or highlight the first one, go to the seventh and use the Shift and Click 
combination.  Then use the Control key to move the cursor over the four 
undesired items.  When the cursor arrow is at the desired items click to begin 
selecting.  Although the cursor will move without holding the control key down, 
anything selected without the control key will select that item and unselect all
the other items.  The Space Bar will act as a toggle switch for selected and 
unselected items.  It will select an unselected item and unselect a selected 
one. To unselect all the items, simply click on a single item.  The program will 
select that one in favor of all the others.  This will leave one item selected 
and it can be unselected with the space bar.  
:p.CES also has a split screen feature that is useful for veiwing
opposite ends of a very long or wide list.  The picture below
shows the Standard Item Catalog split horizontally.  This allows
you see the top and the bottom of the list at the same time.  The
two halves scroll independently of each other, and you can select
from both halves of the list.  
:p.The :hp4.Split Screen Feature:ehp4.
:p.To split a window, move the cursor arrow to the top or bottom of
the scroll bar, until the arrow changes to two parallel bars. 
Then click and drag the bar to position it.  You can position it
anywhere on the screen.  Once positioned, you will have two
halves of the screen that scroll independently of each other.  To
get rid of the bar, either double click on the divider bar or
move it to the edge of the screen.  The screen will return to
normal viewing mode.  
:p.Some windows, such as the Standard Item Catalog, have horizontal
scroll bars as well as a vertical one.   For windows such as
these, you can put a horizontal divider, a vertical divider, or
both in the window.  You put the vertical bar in the window the
same way you put in the horizontal bar.  
:p.The :hp4.4-Way Split Screen Feature:ehp4.
:p.To install the four-way divider, move the cursor arrow to the
bottom right-hand corner of the screen until it becomes a square
with four arrows.  Click and drag the icon to position the
divider bar.  To scroll through the lists, use the scroll bars as
normal.  The right-side scroll bars, in the top half, scroll data
to the left of the bar for the top half.  Similarly, the bottom
left scroll bar, scrolls the data above it, over to the vertical
divider.  
To get rid of the entire divider, double click on it.  To get rid
of one but leave the other divider, move the unwanted divider to
an edge of the window by clicking and dragging.  When the divider
is at the edge of the window, release the mouse button.  The
screen will be left with only one divider. 

  :h1 res=102.Commands
:p.The :hp4.Commands Help:ehp4. option explains the use of commands with this 
application.  
:p.There are two types of commands in CES--window-dependent and window-
independent.  Window-dependent commands yield different results, based on the 
window active when they are used.  For example, the View command can show a job 
item list, a job item breakdown, a job alternate group list, or any of several 
others,  depending on the window that was active when this command was executed.
Window-independent commands can be accessed from anywhere and will always 
provide you with the same results.  The File command is an example of this type 
of command.   It allows you to perform file-related functions such as printing, 
saving, accessing catalogs, etc., even if you are in the middle of some other 
operation or are several sub menus deep.  A very useful result of this is the 
following:  If you are trying to fill in a dialog box and do not know a code for 
an item or do not know the actual item number, you can leave the dialog box for 
a moment and execute the File command.  Since the File command is the path taken 
to all the catalogs provided by CES, you can select a catalog that will have the 
information you need (in this case, the Code Table Catalog or the Standard Item 
or Major Item Listing Catalog) and then copy that information into the dialog 
box.  This is much easier than "backing out" of all the menus you just went 
through, finding the information, then returning through that same path to get 
back to that same dialog box.  


  :h1 res=103.Procedures
:p.The :hp4.Help Procedures:ehp4. Option lists a few  procedures available in this 
application. Select a specific procedure to get further explanation about performing that

   :h1 res=104.Glossary
:p.The :hp4.Help Glossary:ehp4. option displays a list of  terms used by 
BAMS/CES and the help system.

:p.:hp8.Active Window.:ehp8.   A window is active when work can be performed in 
that window.  The program distinguishes the active window from inactive ones by 
illuminating the title bar more brightly.  (If you have a monochrome monitor, 
the title bar will be a darker color.)  With a color monitor, you are allowed to 
choose the color of this bar and most other parts of the screen.  To make a 
window active, simply click on it with a mouse or select it with the keyboard.  
(For detailed instructions on mouse and keyboard use, see the Tutorial chapter.)   
:p.:hp8.Area Type.:ehp8.   Just as a state may be divided into various types of
districts (e.g., congressional districts, election districts, water management 
districts), for purposes of roadway construction and maintenance a state may be 
divided into various types of areas according to terrain, market areas, distance 
from supply centers, urban vs. rural density, or other factors that may have an 
effect on pricing.  All areas are collections of one or more counties.   
:p.:hp8.Area:ehp8.   A subdivision of the state, consisting of one or more 
counties.  
:p.:hp8.Base Date:ehp8.   A base date is a date on which pricing information is 
fixed.  It is used to ensure that all pricing information within a job is 
correct for the time period encompassed by the job.  
Most of the data elements in the data base design are application
oriented; that is they reprsent some information required to perform
the tasks of cost etimation, whether or not a computer is used.  One
data element that is an important exception to that rule is the BaseDate,
which appears in many tables that contain dollar values that change over
time.  The reason for having BaseDates is relativly simple; if there were
only a single data row containing the wages for a particular kind of
laborer, updating that rows values would changes the cost estimates for
every job using that kind of laborer.  

:p.:hp8.Browser:ehp8.   A browser is a built-in search utility that allows you 
to look for a specific item and see its related information.  This is accessed 
though the File, Run command sequence. When you select a browser, CES displays 
a dialog box. After the parameters of the search have been entered, click on OK 
or hit the enter key to execute the command.  (See Chapter 4, under the File 
menu section,  for detailed instructions in executing a browser.)
:p.:hp8.Clipboard:ehp8.   A clipboard is a space in random access memory (RAM)
reserved for particular information.  In the CES context, it refers to the space 
reserved for information that is cut or copied from one place to be inserted 
elsewhere.  This allows you to cut data from one area of a file but retain that 
data in RAM.  Then, this data can be pasted (inserted) back to the same location 
or to a different one, or even to a different program. The program will maintain 
this data in the clipboard until it is replaced by some other data.  If you exit 
the program, you will be asked if you wish to save the information in the 
clipboard.  If you save the document, the data will be saved in the clipboard.
:p.:hp8.Commands:ehp8.  The commands to perform various functions usually have 
a line under one letter of the command.  This is to assist the keyboard user in 
choosing the command.  The underlined letter in combination with the ALT key 
will enact that command. If you are in a dialog box or are selecting preferences 
for something like a print job, you only need type the letter underlined on the 
screen.  There is no need to use the ALT key.
:p.:hp8.Cost Sheet:ehp8.   A cost sheet is used to tally the costs of the 
crew(s) and material(s) needed to complete a task (a part of an item of work).  
Cost sheets are applicable under Cost-Based Estimation only.  When a cost sheet 
is used to estimate the cost of an item in a job, the cost sheet is thereafter 
referred to as a job cost sheet.    
:p.:hp8.Cost-Based Estimation:ehp8.  This is one of five installable estimation 
methods used by BAMS/CES.  It estimates project cost by determining labor, 
equipment, and material costs and summing over the number of projects and over 
time.  For further information on estimation methods used by the program, see 
Chapter 2, Cost Estimation Methodologies.  
:p.:hp8.Crew:ehp8.   A crew is a logical grouping of laborers and equipment 
used to perform an item of work.  The predefined crews that can be used on cost 
sheets are applicable under Cost-Based Estimation only.  
:p.:hp8.Davis-Bacon Wages:ehp8.   Davis-Bacon wages are waces paid to specified 
types of laborers when working on federally funded jobs.  Non Davis-Bacon wages 
are those wages paid to workers on state-funded jobs. 
:p.:hp8.Default:ehp8.   In computer terminology, a default value or setting is 
one chosen automatically by the program unless some other value is specified.  
For instance, the colors on the screen will be in a pre-set (default) 
combination unless they are changed by the user.  The BAMS/CES program has many 
default settings, which represent the most common positions for those settings. 
:p.:hp8.Default Unit Price:ehp8.  For pricing purposes, CES maintains a default
price for each standard item.  The program will use these default unit prices 
when no more rigorous method of estimation is available.  For example, regression, 
averages, and cost-based estimation need many occurrences of an item for their 
prices, which are essentially averages, before they are reliable.  If an item 
exists that does not have a sufficient history to support one of these methods, 
the program will use the unit prices "by default." However, since the default 
unit price does not take item quantity or other job-specific parameters into 
account, it may or may not accurately reflect the actual cost of a standard item 
within the context of a particular job.  For instance, one contractor could be 
working with much larger quantities (leading to lower prices) than another, or 
the area of the state in which he works could have much more inclement weather 
than the one where the original item price was recorded.  For this reason,the 
other estimation methods available to the estimator will usually provide a more 
accurate estimated unit price.  Nonetheless, each default unit price is usually 
gleaned from past experience, and the estimator may wish to compare a unit price 
produced via an alternative estimation methodology against the default unit price 
to see whether the two figures are "in the ballpark" or if one may be in error.  
:p.:hp8.Dependency Link:ehp8.  Dependency links are stated in terms of A, then 
B.  A start to finish link means that A must start before B can finish.  The 
most common type of dependency link is finish-to-start, therefore, A  must 
finish before B can start.  (See Item Dependency for further details.)
:p.:hp8.Dialog Box:ehp8.   A dialog box will be displayed when the program 
needs information from the user to complete a task.  For example, the initial 
log-on box that requests name, date, user authorization, etc. is a dialog box.  
Dialog boxes will appear when you change the default settings, generate a report,
open a new job or program, or perform any of the Edit commands.  You can add 
more changes by selecting the Add More command.  Use the tab key to  move 
through the dialog box.  The ENTER key will accept the changes already made and 
return you to the document.  Cancel changes by selecting the cancel button
or hitting the escape button on the keyboard. Accept by selecting the OK button 
or hitting the ENTER key on the keyboard.  
:p.:hp8.Equipment:ehp8.   Equipment is any mechanical tool or contrivance that 
must be bought, rented, or leased.  
:p.:hp8.Fund:ehp8.   A fund is a source of revenue that can be used to pay for 
all or part of a job.  
:p.:hp8.Item Dependency:ehp8. For scheduling purposes, a separate reference 
table in the database maintains information on item dependency.  If the start 
or finish of work on any Job Item (A) must precede, succeed, or coincide with 
the start or finish of work on another job item (B), job item (A) is dependent 
on job item (B).  For instance, a roadbed must be laid down before paving can 
begin.  Thus, asphalt or concrete are dependent on the gravel (or whatever 
material is) used for the roadbed.  The roadbed material is a predecessor to the 
paving material. The database also maintains information about lag time (the 
number of days that must elapse between the dependent items) and dependency 
(start to finish, etch).
:p.:hp8.Item:ehp8.  See Standard Item.
:p.:hp8.Job Alternate:ehp8.   A job alternate is one of several ways of 
performing a job.  For example, a bridge could have steel, concrete, or wood 
construction.  These are the job alternates.
:p.:hp8.Job Alternate Group:ehp8.  A job alternate group is a type of job for 
which there are alternate methods of construction.  If three job alternates for 
building a bridge are steel, concrete, or wood construction, the job alternate 
group would be the bridge.  
:p.:hp8.Job Breakdown:ehp8.   A Job Breakdown divides a job into its individual 
Job Items.  This method facilitates costing a project by allowing the estimator 
to work with more conveniently sized sections.  This also allows the estimator 
to develop cost estimate subtotals.   
:p.:hp8.Job Item:ehp8.  A standard item included in a job is referred to as a 
job item.   
:p.:hp8.Job:ehp8.   A job is a group of related work items.  A job may also be 
referred to as a project.  
:p.:hp8.Labor:ehp8.  Labor is work performed by people.  CES makes distinctions 
between federally funded (Davis-Bacon) and state-funded (non Davis-Bacon) 
employees, as well as between various types of workers. 
:p.:hp8.List Box:ehp8.   A list box (combination box) is a list of all the 
choices available for this particular action.  For example, the list of files 
from which you choose to open a file is a dialog box.  These are distinguished 
by a down pointing arrow on the right side of the box.  Whenever the program 
provides more than one choice with respect to an issue, it will provide the list 
in a list box.  Select a choice by cursoring down with the highlighting bar or 
by clicking on the item with the left mouse button.  
:p.:hp8.Listing:ehp8.   A listing is a printout of the contents of a single 
catalog or database table.  
:p.:hp8.Major Items:ehp8.  A major item can be any significant cost component 
of a job.  It is a non-biddable item.  A major item can consist of one 
individual standard item (e.g., excavation),  a material  that appears as a
component in numerous standard items (e.g., concrete or steel),  or a component 
of a structure which consists of one or more standard items.   Superstructures, 
traffic maintenance, earthwork, and signaling are all examples of major items.  
:p.:hp8.Material:ehp8.   A material is any quantifiable physical entity which 
is consumed in the performance of an item of work (excluding power or fuel for 
equipment).  
:p.:hp8.Parametric Estimation:ehp8.   Parametric estimation is a broad term for 
cost estimation methods that estimate costs of a project or job based on 
estimates of parameters involved in that job.  A parameter could be quantities 
of materials or items needed or prices of major items.  Parametric estimation 
uses three statistical modeling techniques:  Major Item Price Estimation, Major 
Item Quantity Estimation, and Job Breakdown Estimation.  
Job Breakdown estimation uses major item quantities and major item prices to 
estimate the total cost of a job breakdown.  The total cost accounted for by the 
major items is adjusted upward to account for missing major items and costs that 
do not fit into a major item classification. 
Major Item Price estimation uses statistical regression to determine the 
relationship between major item price and total quantity.  It can also take into 
account one or more qualitative factors such as work type, area within a state, 
and urban/rural classification. 
Major Item Quantity estimation is used to determine approximate quantities of 
the most significant major items for a job breakdown, using only job and job 
breakdown characteristics. 
The coarsest parametric estimate is one in which BAMS/CES Parametric Estimation 
Methods have been used to estimate major item quantities and major item prices 
and to adjust for missing major items.  The estimate can be refined by correcting
the major item quantities when they become known, adding quantities for other, 
less significant major items, and overriding or adjusting the major item unit 
prices produced by the system.  See Chapter 2 for additional details.  
:p.:hp8.Parent/Child Concept:ehp8.   In a Windows environment, a parent window 
is a window that has additional (more specific) data that can be accessed in an 
attached window.  In CES, child windows can be viewed by double clicking on blue 
numbers, choosing the view command and selecting one of the choices in the view 
list, or by clicking on an item in a catalog.  For example, a cost sheet catalog 
is a parent window.  A specific cost sheet that was listed in that catalog is a 
child of the catalog parent.  You would access the particular cost sheet by 
double clicking on that cost sheet.  
:p.:hp8.Parenthetical Information in the Descriptions:ehp8.   In the Reports 
chapter (Chapter 6), there are explanations that are in parentheses.  These are 
labels  that are within the main text of the report or listing, rather than 
titles in the report.  
:p.:hp8.PEMETH Averages Pricing:ehp8.   PEMETH Averages pricing is a BAMS/CES 
installable cost estimation method.  Based on item prices from previous jobs, 
average prices are computed for each item.  When sufficient historical 
occurrences of an item are available, the average prices are separated by area, 
work type, and item quantity.  See Chapter 2, PEMETH Averages, for additional 
details.  
:p.:hp8.PEMETH Regression Pricing:ehp8.   PEMETH Regression pricing is a 
BAMS/CES installable cost estimation method.  Based on item prices from previous 
jobs, regression formulas are used to compute price vs. quantity curves for each 
item.  Sufficient historical occurrences of an item are required for this 
estimation methodology to produce statistically valid results.  
The difference between regression and average pricing is that the regression 
results are continuous.  Average pricing makes price ranges into which items are 
grouped by certain characteristics.  Items very similar to each other can end up 
with very different prices based on their position relative to the cutoff.  
Therefore, regression prices are usually more accurate, and average prices are 
only used when there is an insufficient data history for the regression analysis. 
:p.:hp8.Program Fund:ehp8.  A fund that is available to pay for jobs in a 
particular program.  
:p.:hp8.Program Job:ehp8.  A job that is part of a program.  
:p.:hp8.Program:ehp8.   A program is a collection of jobs that are connected 
by time and/or funding. 
:p.Programs, Jobs, Tasks Programs are at the administrative level--they are 
combinations of jobs, but there is little actual involvement with the actual 
estimation process at this level.   Jobs are where the data is entered and used 
to develop the estimates.  Jobs are broken into tasks.
:p.:hp8.Report:ehp8.  A report is a printed display of some portion of the 
project.  Examples include a Fund Listing report, a Job Estimate report, and a 
Cost Sheet Catalog listing report.  (See Chapter 6 for detailed descriptions of 
each report produced by the program and Chapter 4 for detailed descriptions of 
how to generate and customize reports.) 
:p.:hp8.Selected Item:ehp8.   Selecting an item means highlighting the item 
either by cursoring the highlighting box to the desired item or by clicking on 
that item with the left mouse button.  If a selected item has additional 
information supporting it, such as an attached cost sheet, double clicking on 
the left mouse button will bring up that information. 
:p.:hp8.Significant Major Item:ehp8.   Significant major items are those major 
items that are most significant in estimating a job's cost.  
:p.:hp8.Spec Year:ehp8.   The spec year is a base year used for pricing 
purposes.  Its purpose is similar in nature to the base date above.  
:p.:hp8.Standard Item:ehp8.   Standard items are separately identifiable items 
of work such as tree clearing, tunnel excavation, and structure adjustment or 
repair.  These are stored in a Standard Item Catalog for easy reference and 
access by the estimator and are biddable items.  
:p.:hp8.Structure:ehp8.   A structure is a building or bridge or other non-road 
construction item that is built during and because of the construction program 
or job.
:p.:hp8.Task:ehp8.    A job item can be subdivided into its component tasks.  
The cost of each task is then estimated using the cost sheet for that task, 
which details the labor crew(s), equipment, and material(s) necessary to 
complete the task. This term is only applicable when using cost-based estimation 
to estimate the cost of a job item. 
:p.:hp8.Work Type:ehp8.   All proposals and projects tracked in the BAMS 
production modules and all jobs to be estimated in BAMS/CES can be classified 
according to the primary type of work to be performed.  The  type of work 
(project or job) often has an impact on item pricing, and many of the cost 
estimation methodologies available in BAMS/CES automatically take this into 
account when estimating the cost of a job.  
:p.:hp8.Working Day Calendar:ehp8.   The working day calendar in the BAMS/CES 
database contains information used to determine the number of working days 
available in a given calendar month.  In other words, this is an effort to 
predict all the days when construction will not proceed.  This aids in 
scheduling, since unexpected off days cause time overruns and increase costs.   
:p.:hp8.Working Day:ehp8.  A working day is any normal business day not 
suspended by a holiday.   Time-related values such as productivity (units of an 
item produced), job and job item starting dates, and job duration are usually 
measured in working days.        
:p.:hp8.Zone:ehp8.   A zone is an artificial separation of the state for 
material and labor pricing purposes.  Zones can be drawn without regard for 
county or other pre-existing logical subdivisions of a state.  
:p.:hp8.Zone Type:ehp8.   Just as a state may be divided into various types of 
districts (e.g., congressional districts, election districts, water management 
districts), for purposes of roadway construction and maintenance a state may be 
divided into various types of zones.  Zones can be drawn without regard for 
county lines or other pre-existing logical subdivisions of a state.    

 :h1 res=1808.Index

Scroll through the alphabetically arranged list to find the topic specific to 
the current problem. After you have read the material for the item you selected, 
you can either close the help window or press the ESC key to go back to the 
index list.  In this way you can use a trial and error process to find the 
information you need.   

 :h1 res=1809.About
:p.The :hp4.About:ehp4. command  displays the CES version number and the address 
and fax number of AASHTO.

:p.:hp4.(Hybrid LS).:ehp4.The Hybrid LS label is 
displayed if the unit is a hybrid lump sum.  The term hybrid lump sum is used 
to define a normally unit-priced item that is bid as a  single quantity (lump 
sum).   For instance, often a job such as excavation may require a predictable ]
number of units of some material.  However, the government will ask for a bid 
for the entire job (excavation) to insulate them from the cost of paying for 
additional units of the material at a later date.  Thus, the material in question 
becomes a hybrid lump sum.  It is normally bid by unit, but for this job it is 
treated as a lump sum.

other actions and also states which ones must wait for others to start.  These 
are read...if a, then b ...   For example, a start to finish (SF) dependency for 
A and B would be read, if A starts, then B can finish.  In other words, B cannot 
finish until A has started.  
:p.:hp4.Predecessors.:ehp4.The Predecessors list box shows which items 
must precede the selected job item.  It contains values from three data fields.  
The leftmost value is the  number of a standard item that must precede the

selected job item.  
:p.:hp4.Item Number.:ehp4.The Item Number field shows the item number of the selected job 
item.
:p.:hp4.Quantity.:ehp4.The Quantity field presents the necessary quantity of the selected 
job item.
:p.:hp4.Unit.:ehp4.The Unit field shows the common unit of measure for the item.  
:p.:hp4.(Hybrid LS).:ehp4.The Hybrid LS label is 
displayed if the unit is a hybrid lump sum.  The term hybrid lump sum 
is used to define a normally unit-priced item that is bid 
as a  single quantity (lump sum).   For instance, often a job such as excavation 
may require a predictable number of units of some material.  However, the 
government will ask for a bid for the entire job (excavation) to insulate 
them from the cost of paying for additional units of the material at a later 
date.  Thus, the material in question becomes a hybrid lump sum.  It is normally 
bid by unit, but for this job it is treated as a lump sum.
:p.:hp4.Unit Price.:ehp4.The Unit Price field shows the estimated price of one unit of the 
job item.
:p.:hp4.Extension.:ehp4.The Extension field shows the the estimated total cost for this job 
item.  It is equal to the quantity times the unit price.

in this field.
:p.:hp4.Long Description.:ehp4.The Long Description field provides a detailed description of 
the selected item.
:p.:hp4.Suppl.:ehp4.scription.   The Supplemental Description field allows the estimator to 
record any additional description necessary.
:p.:hp4.Start Time.:ehp4.This is the time lag, in days, between the letting date and the 
expected start date for this item.[CHECK] 
:p.:hp4.Rounding Precision.:ehp4.This field shows the rounding precision for this item.  
This is chosen by the estimator.
:p.:hp4.Duration.:ehp4.The Duration field shows the expected time necessary to complete 
an item, in days. 
:p.:hp4.Dependency.:ehp4. A dependency relationship states which actions must come before 
other actions and also states which ones must wait for others to start.  These 
are read...if a, then b ...   For example, a start to finish (SF) dependency for 
A and B would be read, if A starts, then B can finish.  In other words, B cannot 
finish until A has started.  
:p.:hp4.Predecessors.:ehp4.The Predecessors list box shows which items 
must precede the selected job item.  It contains values from three data fields.  
The leftmost value is the  number of a standard item that must precede the selected 
job item.  The center value identifies the dependency between the items (SF = Start 
to Finish; SS = Start to Start; FS = Finish to Start; FF = Finish to Finish).  The 
rightmost value indicates the minimum number of days that must elapse between the 
items. (See the Introduction Chapter for a definition of dependency relationships.) 
:p.:hp4.Successors.:ehp4.The Successors list box shows which items must 
succeed (come after) the selected job item.  It contains values from three data 
fields.  The leftmost value is the number of a standard item that must succeed 
the selected job item.  The center value identifies the dependency between the 
items (SF = Start to Finish; SS = Start to Start; FS = Finish to Start; FF = 
Finish to Finish).  The rightmost value indicates the minimum number of days 
that must elapse between the items.  (See the Introduction Chapter for a definition 
of dependency relationships.)

next box.  If you hit enter, the program automatically accepts all data entered 
up to this point and returns you to the Job Breakdown screen.
There is also a box that allows you to choose whether or not you want a detailed 
estimate.  A non-detailed estimate would use parametric estimation.  If there are 
job items, the program will use a more specific type of estimation method.
If the job breakdown is for a structure (such as a bridge), the Job Breakdown 
Structure window will be visible.  If the job is for something other than a 
structure (such as a road or an excavation), the Non-Structure Job Breakdown 
window will be visible.

CES provides you with a list of reports available at this time.  You will have 
the option to print three attachments to the Job Estimate reports--the 
Cost-Based Estimate, the PEMETH Averages report, and the PEMETH Regression report.  
The program will print the default report requested unless you cancel.  However, 
you can tailor the presentation of this report with this box.  In this case, the 
first choice (unchecked) says it will print the long item descriptions by 
default.  You can select to print only the short descriptions if the complete 
descriptions are unimportant for this print job.  The short description will be 
the beginning text of the long description truncated to a standard size. Also 
printable from this window will be the cost-based estimate, PEMETH averages, 
PEMETH regression. The second choice allows you to include the comments made 
about the various levels of this job, presented in a comment log.  The default 
(unchecked) report will not include these comments.

you can select to print only the scheduled items or only the critical path items.   
You can also choose the order in which the list is sorted and the criteria by 
which items will be selected to print.  The choices in each rectangle are

   :h1 res=200001.General Structure of CES  
      :p.BAMS/CES operates through a series of layered windows, with each
successive window offering more detailed information than the
previous window.  At each window level, you have the option of
editing (adding, changing, or deleting) the contents of the
current window or moving to the next window in the chain (by
viewing subset windows).  In this way, you are able to plan in
global terms, to develop a rough estimate of cost, and then add
more specific information to hone the estimate.

      
   :h1 res=200002.Types of Commands  
      :p.There are two types of commands in CES--window-dependent and
window-independent.  Window-dependent commands yield different
results, based on the window active when they are used.  For
example, the View command can show a job item list, a job item
breakdown, a job alternate group list, or any of seveal others, 
depending on the window that was active when this command was
executed.  
:sl compact.
:li.Window-independent commands can be accessed from anywhere and
will always provide you with the same results.  The File command
is an example of this type of command.   It allows you to perform
file-related functions such as printing, saving, accessing
catalogs, etc., even if you are in the middle of some other
operation or are several sub-menus deep.  
:li.A very useful result of this is the following:  if you are trying
to fill in a dialog box and do not know a code for an item or do
not know the actual item number, you can leave the dialog box for
a moment and execute the File command.  Since the File command is
the path taken to all the catalogs provided by CES, you can
select a catalog that will have the information you need (in this
case, the Code Table Catalog or the Standard Item or Major Item
Listing Catalog) and then copy that information into the dialog
box.  This is much easier than "backing out" of all the menus you
just went through, finding the information, then returning
through that same path to get back to that same dialog box.  
:esl.


   :h1 res=200003.CES Colors  
      :p.Window Backgroung colors
CES uses specific colors for windows and data inside windows to
convey the status of that window or data.  
:sl compact.
:li.When you perform an action such as entering the data for a new
job, the program will digest that information and provide you
with another window that presents the data in a logical way.  The
window may be visible but not yet accessible, due to the amount
of processing time necessary.  CES indicates this either by
displaying the message <working> in the title bar and/or by
keeping the window gray until it is fully functional, at which
time it will become white.  
:li.Data Colors
:li.The data in CES windows is presented in the following colors on
the screen:  black, red, and blue.  The names of lists, windows,
or data titles are presented in black.  The actual information
will be presented in either red or blue.  Blue numbers signify
that this number is the result of  computations or comes from
several sources or has some other discoverable origin.  
Double clicking (clicking twice in rapid succession with the left
mouse button) on one of these blue numbers will access the next
level of detail for this number.  This process can be continued
until the data item is broken down to individual unit cost for
each component part.  
:li.Numbers such as total cost and totals adjusted for inflation will
be in blue.   For example, after opening an existing program, you
will see a total line and a total adjusted for inflation line in
blue.  Double clicking on either of these numbers will take you
to the job level for this program, providing you with a list of
all the jobs that are a part of this program.  Continue this
process to see a specific job, and then a specific job breakdown
of that job, and then the cost sheets, etc. 
:li.Gray vs. Black Commands in Menus
:li.As in other Windows format programs, if a menu selection makes no
sense at the current time or is denied to you for some other
reason, that command will be gray instead of black.  This allows
you to see all the possible commands, even if they are not
accessible to you at the moment.  You can then determine why a
particular command is not available and what you have to do to
make it available.   
:li.For instance, when you first open CES, the Print, Import and
Export, and Close commands make no sense since there are no files
open.  Similarly, there is nothing to edit, so the whole Edit
menu will be gray.  The Utilities and View menus will be active
since you can adjust global viewing and presentation preferences
without having a file open.  CES also records user status, due to
the sensitive nature of some of the data.  Therefore, some of the
lists will be view-only or will not even open, depending on the
status of the user.
:esl.

   :h1 res=200004.Important Default Settings  
      :p.Combination (list) Boxes
:sl compact.
:li.The combination boxes in CES will always highlight the first
choice in the list.  Therefore if you immediately hit enter or
select OK without looking, that item will be selected. 
Dialog Boxes
:li.CES has many dialog boxes.  These are boxes that request
information from 

the user in order to complete an action.  In
most cases, when these boxes ask for a measurement value such as
depth of pavement, they do not specifiy the unit in which the
value will be measured.  Some common values and their units
follow:  
:li.o For pavement:  depth is measured in inches, width in feet, and
length in miles.  
:li.o For structures, length and width are measured in feet.  
:li.o Whenever the program asks for location, you must enter latitude
and longitude, in degrees, minutes, and seconds.   
:li.o Percentage values must be typed in as decimals or as a number
with a percent sign after it (8 percent would be entered as .08
or 8%).  A whole number will be interpreted as that number times
100%.  Therefore, if you type just the number 8, CES would record
it as 800 percent. 
:li.The dialog boxes that come with the Edit, Change command sequence
will highlight the OK choice by default.  Thus, if you hit enter
at any time during the editing process, CES will automatically
accept those changes.  For operations that could negatively
affect your work (such as deleting standard items) the default
setting is to have the NO choice button highlighted.  In this
way, you are protected from deleting something by accident. 
The Print dialog default to the print condition.  Therefore,
hitting enter immediately will cause CES to print the default
report, without any specialization.
:esl.

   :h1 res=200005.Running CES  
      :p.From OS2, click on the CES menu choice.  The CES screen comes up
(blank).  You then choose whether to open a new program or job or
an existing one.  You do not have to open a job or program--many
CES features (such as accessing catalogs) are accessible from the
main menu screen

   :h1 res=200006.Password and Log-on  
      :p.Before you are able to open a new or existing job, you must
provided the system with your password and user name.  The
passwords for CES are case-sensitive as well as being sensitive
to spaces or other typed entries.  This means that if your
password is defined with some upper case and some lower case
letters, it will have to be typed in that way.  It will not be
visible as you type it, and therefore you will have to type it
twice.  The program will deny access until both of the entries
match.  
:p.In addition to the password, you must logon with a user name. 
Your logon request can be denied for the following reasons:  (1) 
you typed the username incorrectly,  (2) the username you typed
is not valid, (3) the password you typed was invalid, or (4) the 
System Manager is either installing or updating the system and
has denied access to all users.


   :h1 res=200007.Activating and Closing Windows  
      :p.Click on any window to make it the active window.  If the window
you wish to activate is not visible, you have four choices:  
:sl compact.
:li.(1) Begin closing windows until the desired window is exposed. 
You only need to see a portion small enough to identify the
window, to click on it.  
:li.(2) Use the minimize down arrow (in the top right-hand corner of
any active window) to shrink the window to icon size.  This will
expose the windows "hidden" beneath it.  
:li.(3)  Change the size of the windows.  If the window has a border,
you can position the cursor arrow just at the edge of the border
until the arrow becomes a double arrow that straddles the border
line.  You can then drag the mouse to shrink one side of the
window.  If the arrow is placed at a corner of a window, you can
resize two borders at once.  
:li.(4)  Move the window by clicking in the title bar and then
dragging the window (at its current size) to a new location on
the screen.  
:li.Closing Windows:
:li.Due to the tree structure of this program, there will be times
when many windows will be open at one time.  You may wish to
close all of them before exiting or you may simply close them to
keep system performance as high as possible.  In either case,
there are two ways to close all the open windows:  The obvious
way is to close each window in the opposite order in which they
were opened.  However, this can be frustrating and time-consuming
if more than three or four are open.
:li.The simpler way to do this is to click on the first window opened
(the one on the "bottom").  CES will then superimpose it over the
other windows (its children).  You then close this one (the
parent) and all its children close automatically with it.  This
demands some foresight in that some portion of the window must be
visible in order to be able to click on it.  In addition, it is
helpful if you can see the window title.  
:li.Therefore, a good method for using multiple windows in CES is to
move each new window just beneath its parent.  This is done by
clicking in the title bar and dragging it to its new location. 
Then the title bar of each window will be visible.  This gives
other benefits as well since it allows you to selectively go back
to an earlier window.  
:li.This method works for any two or more windows that have a
parent/child relationship.  Therefore, if you were five or six
windows deep in the job menu (for instance at the job item
window), you could close all the windows except the job window by
clicking on the immediate child of the job window.  This will
leave the job window open thus allowing you to take a different
path of windows.  
:li.This only works on windows that have a parent/child relationship. 
Therefore, if six layers of job windows and a couple of program
windows are open, closing the parent job window will clear the
screen of job windows, but will leave the program windows.   
Esl.

   :h1 res=200008.Creating New Programs or Jobs  
      :p.To create a new program or job, use the File command, then choose
[New program] or [New Job].  The screen will display a full
screen dialog box with entry fields and combination boxes. (See
the File section of Chapter 4 for a detailed description of the
data entry procedure.)  Enter the data in these fields and press
enter or click on OK.  The program will digest the entries and
provide you with another blank screen.  At this point, you can
choose the View command and begin to add things such as job
breakdowns, user lists, fund lists, alternate groups, etc.  This
will cause the program to begin accumulating costs.  You can go
back to the job window at any time to view the cost of the
program up to this point.

   :h1 res=200009.Saving and Exiting  
      :p.CES automatically stores all data entered into it.  Therefore you
do not have to perform a save procedure before you exit.  To exit
the program, choose the File, Exit command sequence or double
click on the control bar in the upper left hand corner of the
main screen.  This action will return you to the Program Manager
in OS/2.  To exit OS/2 you must first perform a shutdown from the
Program Manager.  (See your OS/2 support documentation for this
procedure.)


   :h1 res=200010.The Big Picture  
      :p.To make a detailed estimate, you go through these 7 or 8 menu
choices, providing all the detail you have available.  Each of
these choices will take you several layers or more in the CES
structure.  You can the use the "window map" in the Users Guide to help
keep track of your position in CES.  
:p.Windows Available from the Open Job Command
:sl compact.
:li.Each time you enter new information, CES adds it to the job and
computes its effect on total cost.
Click on File, then New Job.  CES will display the Add Job dialog
box. 
:li.The top three fields, Item Number, Description, and Unit, are
grayed.  This means you can only enter these values by selecting
from the list provided.  The program automatically fills in the
item number, description, and unit fields.  Once you have done
this, type in the quantity and unit price.  Choose the estimation
method by selecting from the list attached to this combination
box.  With a mouse you click on the down arrow to see the whole
list.  With a keyboard you use the arrow keys to scroll through
the list.  After adding this item, select OK or press ENTER to
finish adding the job item.  CES returns you to the Job Item List
window.  The item you just entered will occupy the place of the
item where your cursor was at the time of the addition. 
Note:  The Job Item List window must be full width in order for
you to see the scroll bars.  CES will truncate screens to some
extent, but if there is too much text in the window, the borders
simply will not be displayed.  Therefore, if you are not using a
full screen to work in CES, you may not be able to see the scroll
bar.  Simply drag the right border of CES out until you are able
to see the scroll bar.  
:li.Printing the job estimate report.
From the Job window, select File, Print.  CES will display a list
of the reports printed by the program.  CES requires you to print
a report from the applicable window.  Therefore, when you open
the print menu, most of the choices you see are grayed, meaning
they cannot be printed from this window.  In this case, three
reports are represented with black letters--the Job Estimate, the
Job Funding Report, and the Job Item Schedule Listing.   Select
the Job Estimate Report.  CES will display the dialog
box with two choices for report customization.  
:li.Part 2:  Completing the Job
:li.Adding the rest of the items.
:li.Reopen the job you created in the first section.  Add at least X
of the items listed below.  Since you will be adding multiple
items, choose the Add More option after each item.  This will
save you time and keystrokes by always presenting a blank dialog
box rather than putting you back to the Job List window.
Provide list of items to be added to the tutorial project here.
:li.Setting up users.
:li.Select the Job User List from the 8 choices provided.  You will
see a list of users.  Add several new team members by perfroming
the Edit, Add command sequence.  CES will display the dialog box:
:li.Fill in the data boxes to enter the first person on your team.  
Then, select Add More.  
:esl.


   :h1 res=200011.Default Unit Prices  
:p.Default Unit Prices are assigned to each Standard Item by some 
upper echelon.  They may be used in the absence, or in place of other
determination methods.

   :h1 res=200012.Cost-Based Estimation  
:lm margin=3.
:p.  Cost-Based estimation divides the work of a Standard Item into 
one or more tasks, with each task being a separate cost sheet.  Note the cost
sheets are not copies but rather references to one source cost sheet in the
catalog list.
:p. 
:p.:lines align=center.Cost-Based Estimate Procedure:elines.
:p.  To build a cost based estimate for a Standard Item, highlight the item in the
Standard Item Catalog list then from the View menu select Cost Based Estimates.
This will open the "Cost-Based Estimates for X9X9X9" windows.  From this window
select Edit/Add to name and describe the cost based estimate that is to be
attached to the standard item; note the Active check box is used to enable or
disable the use of this particular cost sheet in the cost calculations for 
the standard item.
:p.  After the add dialog box is exited, highlight the new Cost-Based Estimate 
in the list and from the View menu select Task List.  The tasks, ie. cost
sheets, are added to the item's cost based estimate task list from the Cost
Sheet Catalog list in the dialog box.  In the task dialog box (either Edit/Add or
Edit/Change) are where any deviations from the from the attached Cost Sheet
that are specific to the Standard Item are made.  This is done by changing
the percentages in the "Production Adj" and "Material Qty Adj" edit boxes.
  These percentage adjustments are applied only to the task for the current 
Standard Item and are NOT changes in the Cost Sheet itself.

:p.  Also note that a task's Cost Sheet may have a different Unit of measure from the
Standard Item to which it is being attached; it is up to the user to enter the
conversion factor in the "Quantity Per Item Unit" edit box.  For instance a 
Cost Sheet may be in units of square feet (SF) and the Standard Item may be in 
units of square yards (SY).  As an example, a cost sheet that determines the
expenses for 5 square feet of 8 inch reinforced concrete might be attached
to a standard item that is measured as 1 square yard of finished road surface;
then the value entered into the task's "Quantity Per Item Unit" edit field
would then be 1.8 (there are 9 square feet to 1 square yard so 1.8 x 5 SF
equals 9 SF or 1 SY).  A more interesting conversion case would be a cost
sheet in tons and a standard item in lane-miles. 


   :h1 res=200013.PEMETH Averages  
:p.The estimated price of an item using this method is currently calculated
using data loaded from the BAMS/DSS BRPEMETH analysis model.  Historical
information about quantity level, work type, and geographic area are used
to compute the price for the item.  Please refer to section 2.4 of the
BAMS/CES User's Guide.

   :h1 res=200014.PEMETH Regression  
      :p.Please refer to section 2.5 of the User's Guide.

   :h1 res=200015.Parametric Estimation  
:p.Parametric Estimation projects cost by considering the parameters of the
project and involves various statistical modeling techniques.  Please refer
to section 2.3 the User's Guide.

   :h1 res=200016.Scheduling Job items  
:p.From within one of a job's many windows, open the Utiliies menu and 
select the 'Schedule Job Items' option.  This will start a background
series of calculations that will update the affected windows.  Do not try
and add or delete any job items until the windows are done changing, usually
about a minute or so.

   :h1 res=200017. Entering Job Comments  
:p.These are notations made by the estimator that once the dialog box is exited
can NOT be edited.  Additional comments may be added at a later time to clarify 
or nullify previous comments.

   :h1 res=200018.Adding job alternates  
      :p.Please refer to the User's Guide.

   :h1 res=200019.Running Browsers  
      :p.Please refer to the User's Guide.

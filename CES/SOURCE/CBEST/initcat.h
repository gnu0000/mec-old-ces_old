 * Use the ITIDLLI.OBJ module when your DLL does not use the C run time
 * library.  Use the ITIDLLC.OBJ module when you need to use the C run
 * time library, and you need to initialize your DLL.  Note that when
 * you do this, you will have to link with CRTDLL_I.OBJ, a standard 
 * Microsoft module.
 *
 * Note: Do not rename this file to DLLINIT, since this file name
 * is already used by Microsoft for C run time library initialization.
